### Issues/Bugs
- 'Forget Password' button on login screen overflows and looks smaller, doesnt work either
- ~~chat message bubble - time overflows~~
- avatar and logout seem too close to Tic Tac Toe title on mobile
- user not authenticated when total page refresh
- cannot pick X or O, can only be X
- ~~does not mark win for diagonals~~
- desktop -> X and 0 are HUGE!
- desktop -> message bubble really huge and if more than one, you can't see top
- on form submission if error occurs, state is lose even though it looks the field is filled with text
